          <div id="h1">Technology is the sum of any techniques, skills, methods, and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. 
              Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines to allow for operation without detailed knowledge of their workings.
               Systems (e.g. machines) applying technology by taking an input, changing it according to the system's use, and then producing an outcome are referred to as technology systems or technological systems.

                The simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools. The prehistoric invention of shaped stone tools followed by the discovery of how to control fire increased sources of food. The later Neolithic Revolution extended this,
                 & quadrupled the sustenance available from a territory.
                 The invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment.

                Developments in historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet,
                 have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale

                Technology has many effects. It has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class.
                 Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products known as pollution and deplete natural resources to the detriment of Earth's environment.
                 Innovations have always influenced the values of a society and raised new questions in the ethics of technology.
                 Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, and the challenges of bioethics.

                Philosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it.
                 Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar reactionary movements criticize the pervasiveness of technology,
                  arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and
                   techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition.

                The distinction between science, engineering, and technology is not always clear. Science is systematic knowledge of the physical or material world gained through observation and experimentation. 
                <br><br>
                Technologies are not usually exclusively products of science, because they have to satisfy requirements such as utility, usability, and safety.
                <br>
Engineering is the goal-oriented process of designing and making tools and systems to exploit natural phenomena for practical human means, often (but not always) using results and techniques from science. 
<br><br>
The development of technology may draw upon many fields of knowledge, including scientific, engineering, mathematical, linguistic, and historical knowledge, to achieve some practical result.
<br><br>
Technology is often a consequence of science and engineering, although technology as a human activity precedes the two fields. For example, science might study the flow of electrons in electrical conductors by using already-existing tools and knowledge. 
<br><br>
This new-found knowledge may then be used by engineers to create new tools and machines such as semiconductors, computers, and other forms of advanced technology. 
<br><br>
In this sense, scientists and engineers may both be considered technologists; the three fields are often considered as one for the purposes of research and reference

                The exact relations between science and technology, in particular, have been debated by scientists, historians, and policymakers in the late 20th century, in part because the debate can inform the funding of basic and applied science.
                 In the immediate wake of World War II, for example, it was widely considered in the United States that technology was simply "applied science" and that to fund basic science was to reap technological results in due time.
                  An articulation of this philosophy could be found explicitly in Vannevar Bush's treatise on postwar science policy, Science – The Endless Frontier: "New products, new industries, and more jobs require continuous additions to knowledge of the laws of nature ... 
                  This essential new knowledge can be obtained only through basic scientific research. In the late-1960s, however,
                   this view came under direct attack, leading towards initiatives to fund science for specific tasks (initiatives resisted by the scientific community).
                 The issue remains contentious, though most analysts resist the model that technology is a result of scientific research

                Thomas P. Hughes stated that because technology has been considered as a key way to solve problems, we need to be aware of its complex and varied characters to use it more efficiently.<br>
                 What is the difference between a wheel or a compass and cooking machines such as an oven or a gas stove? Can we consider all of them, only a part of them, or none of them as technologies?
                 <br>
                Technology is often considered too narrowly; according to Hughes, "Technology is a creative process involving human ingenuity".[72] This definition's emphasis on creativity avoids unbounded definitions that may mistakenly include cooking "technologies," 
                but it also highlights the prominent role of humans and therefore their responsibilities for the use of complex technological systems.
            </div>
            <br>
            <br>
            <div id="h13">
                Yet, because technology is everywhere and has dramatically changed landscapes and societies, Hughes argues that engineers, scientists, and managers have often believed that they can use technology to shape the world as they want.
                <br>
                 They have often supposed that technology is easily controllable and this assumption has to be thoroughly questioned.[71] For instance, Evgeny Morozov particularly challenges two concepts: "Internet-centrism" and "solutionism.
                 <br>
                 Internet-centrism refers to the idea that our society is convinced that the Internet is one of the most stable and coherent forces.
                 <br>
                  Solutionism is the ideology that every social issue can be solved thanks to technology and especially thanks to the internet.
                 <br>
                  In fact, technology intrinsically contains uncertainties and limitations. According to Alexis Madrigal's review of Morozov's theory, to ignore it will lead to "unexpected consequences that could eventually cause more damage than the problems they seek to address.
                  
                 Benjamin R. Cohen and Gwen Ottinger also discussed the multivalent effects of technology

            <br>
            <div id="h14">
                Therefore, recognition of the limitations of technology, and more broadly, scientific knowledge, is needed – especially in cases dealing with environmental justice and health issues. 
                Ottinger continues this reasoning and argues that the ongoing recognition of the limitations of scientific knowledge goes hand in hand with scientists and engineers’ new comprehension of their role. Such an approach of technology and science 
                "[require] technical professionals to conceive of their roles in the process differently.
                 [They have to consider themselves as] collaborators in research and problem solving rather than simply providers of information and technical solutions.

Future Technology
            </div>
            <div id="h16">
                heories of technology often attempt to predict the future of technology based on the high technology and science of the time. As with all predictions of the future, however, technology is uncertain.

In 2005, futurist Ray Kurzweil predicted that the future of technology would mainly consist of an overlapping "GNR Revolution" of genetics, nanotechnology and robotics, with robotics being the most important of the three.This future revolution has been explored in films, novels, and video games, which have predicted the creation of many inventions, as well as foreseeing future events.<br><br>
 Such inventions and events include a government-controlled simulation that resulted from massive robotics advancements, (The Matrix), a society that has rid itself of procreation due to improvements in genetic engineering (Brave New World), and a police state enforced by the government using datamining, nanobots, and drones (Watch Dogs). Humans have already made some of the first steps toward achieving the GNR revolution.
 <br><br>
 Recent discoveries and ingenuity has allowed us to create robotics in the form of Artificial Intelligence, as well as in the physical form of robots. Artificial intelligence has been used for a variety of purposes, including personal assistants in a smart phone, the first of which was Siri, released in the iPhone 4s in 2011 by Apple.[86] Some believe that the future of robotics will involve a 'greater than human non-biological intelligence.<br><br>This concept can be compared to that of a 'rogue AI,' an Artificial Intelligence that has gained self-awareness, and tries to eradicate humanity. 
 <br>Others believe that the future will involve AI servants creating an easy and effortless life for humankind, where robots have become the primary work force. This future shares many similarities with the concept of planned obsolescence, however, planned obsolescence is seen as a "sinister business strategy.'[88] Man-controlled robots such as drones have been developed to carry out tasks such as bomb defusal and space exploration. Universities such as Harvard are working towards the invention of autonomous robots to be used in situations that would aid humans, such as surgery robots, search and rescue robots, and physical therapy robots.
 <br><br>
 Genetics have also been explored, with humans understanding genetic engineering to a certain degree. However, gene editing is widely divisive, and usually involves some degree of eugenics. Some have speculated the future of human engineering to include 'super humans,' humans who have been genetically engineered to be faster, stronger, and more survivable than current humans. Others think that genetic engineering will be used to make humans more resistant or completely immune to some diseases.Some even suggest that 'cloning,' the process of creating an exact copy of a human, may be possible through genetic engineering.
 <br><br>
Some believe that within the next 10 years, humans will discover nanobot technology, while others believe that we are centuries away from its invention. It is believed by futurists that nanobot technology will allow humans to 'manipulate matter at the molecular and atomic scale.' This discovery could pave the way for many scientific and medical advancements, such as curing new diseases, or inventing new, more efficient technology. It is also believed that nanobots could be injected or otherwise inserted inside the human body, and replace certain parts, keeping humans healthy for an incredibly long amount of time, or combating organ failure to a degree.
<br><br>
The 'GNR revolution,' would bring a new age of technology and advancement for humanity like none that has been seen before.

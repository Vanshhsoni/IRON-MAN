According to the Sources 5G generation standards may beroolled out in approximately early 2020s. However, significant
debate continued, on what 5G is about. Technologies in fifth
generation will going to offer tremendous data capabilities and
unrestricted call volumes and infinite </P>  

<P> Data broadcast together within latest mobile operating system.
Fifth generation should make an important difference and add
more services and benefits to the world over 4G. Fifth
generation should be more intelligent technology that
interconnects the entire world without limits.[2]Due to 5G, all
the services and applications will be accessed by single IP
address as telephony, gaming and many other multimedia
applications. 
<br><br>Upcoming (implemented in some countries )IPv6
(Version of Internet Protocol) is used by 5G.Besides high data
rates and large bandwidth, 5G will also offer handling of
billions of devices and less network congestion, allowing for
better connectivity The benefit of 5G can be easily afford by
the common people. To compete with on going wireless
technologies in market ,5G has to bring something pioneering
in the market .The brilliance of 5G can be predicted by the
features and offers that are offered in 4G technology.<br><br>
 Voice
 rates , internet packs , free voice calling are the main features
that came up with the emergence of 4G technologies. So, it is
expecting the calling rates will be going to be more cheaper
than ever , internet packs for mobile will be make available at
such a lower rate that any one can afford to buy them. Along
with these , another amazing features will be the part of 5G .
<br><br>
This upcoming technology is expected to be a mixture of
network tiers of different sizes, transmission powers, back
haul corrections and radio access technology accessed by
unpretending number of intelligent and heterogeneous wireless
devices. 5G will help support the massive growth in the
Internet of Things (ITT) and enable devices to communicate
with each other seamlessly through the convergence of
mobile communications and computing 
<br><br>
The 5G networks will also bring intelligence across the entire
    network, from the device to the data centre. The 5G
    technology will be kept as an open platform on different
    layers from the physical layer up to the application layer. [4]
    The emerging demands on 5G are far more comprehensive
    than previous generations. This leads to an assumption</p>

    <div align="center" id="h3">Why 5G ?</div>
    <div id="h4">
<P>     Today , when we are in the middle of the so called fast
4G revolution , in that the superfast mobile data service is still
        in its infancy in both coverage and speed capabilities. While
        the current technologies capable of offering internet speeds of
        up to 150Mbps in areas offering double LTE connections, and
        LTE-A (or 4G+ on EE) available in London and select cities
        in the UK,(In India too) increasing that to 300Mbps, 
        <br>why on
        Earth do we need anything more like 5G technology that is
        going to be expected many folds faster than previous
        ones ?Infact, if we go to the end of maximum speed of 4G
        which will be in coming years, we can achieve mobile
        broadband speeds of up to 1Gbps – one gig. 
        <br>That’s staggering
        to contemplate, especially as we don’t even have fixed line
        broadband that fast yet. So why the need for 5G?  </P>
        <br><br>
    <P> Now to answer the question "Why do we need 5G ?"
        following statements express the answer much better :
        The one of the major -major benefit of 5G over the
        previous 4G , is not only it's speed or bandwidth of data
        transmission which could possibly be between 10Gbps to
        100Gbps but the latency.
        <br> Talking about the current scenario
        4G is capable of providing between 40ms and 60ms, which is
        low-latency but not enough to provide real-time response.
        <br>
        Examples like Multiplayer gaming requires a lower latency
        than that to ensure that when you hit a button, the remote
        server responds instantly and for this 5g will be there to do it's
        work. Possibly and respectively the latency of 5G can be as
        low as 1ms or can go higher to 10 ms which is far lower </P><br><br>

         <div align="center" id="h5"> STRUCTURE AND ARCHITECTURE </div>
         <div id="h6">
<P>  It is estimating that the architecture of 5G is going to be more
    advance in nature. The architecture design for 5G which is
    all-IP based model for wireless and mobile networks .[7]The
    system will be based on the user centric concept(while
    previous versions were based on the operator centric concept)
    in which there will be a user terminal (which has a crucial
    role in the new architecture) and a number of independent,
    autonomous radio access technologies.
    <br><Br> Within each of the
    terminals, each of the radio access technologies is seen as the
    IP link to the outside Internet world. In this architecture,
    mobile terminal has the capability to of changing thr
    RAT(Radio Access Technology). However, there should be
    different radio interface for each Radio Access Technology
    (RAT) in the mobile terminal. 
    <br><br>For an example, if we want to
    have access to four different RATs, we need to have four
    different access -specific interfaces in the mobile terminal, and
    to have all of them active at the same time, with aim to have
    this architecture to be functional. Within each of the terminals,
    each of the RAT is considered as the IP link to the outside
    Internet world. However, there should be different radio
    interface for each Radio Access Technology (RAT) in the

    four different RATs, we need to have four different access -
    specific interfaces in the mobile terminal,and to have all of

 <div align="center" id="h7">FUTURE SCOPE 5G  </div>
 <div id="h8">
<P>  Several researches and various discussions have already
    started across the world among technologists, researchers,
    academicians, vendors, operators, and governments about the
    innovations, implementation, viability, and security concerns
    and its future scope and replacement of 5G. 
    <BR><BR>
    As proposed,
    loaded with multiple advance features starting from the super
    high speed internet service to smooth ubiquitous service, 5G
    will unlock many of the problems. However, the question is —
    in a situation, where the previous technologies (4G and 3G)
    are still under process and in many parts yet to be started; what
    will be the future of 5G? Will there be any problem that will
    happen in 5G and Will there be 6G ?The main objective of the
    5th generation technology is to provide incredible and
    remarkable data capabilities, unhindered call volumes, and
    immeasurable data broadcast within the latest mobile
    operating system. 
    <BR><BR>Hence, this technology will be more
    intelligent technology, which will interconnect the entire
    world without limits. Likewise, our world would have
    universal and uninterrupted access to information,
    communication, and entertainment that will open a new
    dimension to our lives and will change our life style
    meaningfully.
    <BR><BR> Moreover, governments and regulators can use
    this technology as an opportunity for the good governance and
    can create healthier environments, which will definitely
    encourage continuing investment in 5G, the next generation
    technology. If we get the success of achieving the true and
    maximum limit of 5G , then there will not be any need of 6G
    on earth. If correct infrastructure is used, upgrading
    hardware’s and software’s requirement , then future is bright
    and very lightning fast. We have to keep in mind that 4G can
    take up to 1Gbps and 5G will be beyond our imagination !! </P>

    <b><u><li> SPEED UPGRADES  </li>   </b>  </u> 
 </ul>
 <p> Each wireless network generation has reflected a significant increase in speed,<br> and the benefits of 5G—the fifth generation of cellular network technology—will push far beyond 4G LTE.   </p> 
 <p> Predicted speeds of up to 10 Gbps represent up to a 100x increase compared to 4G.1 In practical terms, 4G vs.<br> 5G speed enhancements will mean exciting possibilities for consumers.<br> Transferring a high-resolution movie at peak download speeds will go from taking seven minutes to just six seconds.<br> That time savings could mean being able to grab that new hit film before the flight attendant asks you to put your phone in airplane mode. </p>
 <p>After carriers roll out full 5G features, consumers and businesses may begin to consider 5G networks a strong alternative for fast broadband connections. </p>
 <ul>
    <b><u><li>LOW LETENCY </li></b>  </u>
  </ul>
 <p> Latency measures how long a signal takes to go from its source to its receiver, and then back again.<br> One of the goals for each wireless generation has been to reduce latency.<br> New 5G networks will have even lower latency than 4G LTE, with the round-trip transmission of data taking less than five milliseconds.  </p>
 <p> 5G latency will be faster than human visual processing, making it possible to control devices remotely in near-real time.<br> Human reaction speed will become the limiting factor for remote applications that use 5G and <br>IoT—and many new applications will involve machine-to-machine communication that isn’t limited by how quickly humans can respond.</p>
 <p> While agriculture, manufacturing, and logistics will all benefit from lower latency, gamers also eagerly anticipate the 5G rollout.<br> The combination of high speed and minimal lag is perfect for virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) applications, which are likely to explode in popularity as connectivity improvements create a more seamless, immersive experience. </p>
 <ul>
    <b><u> <li> ENHANCED CAPACITY </li>   </b>  </u>
 </ul>
 <P> Speed is exciting, but one of the questions on the minds of analysts and industry leaders is this: How will 5G help businesses scale their technology initiatives?</P>
 <p> 5G will deliver up to 1,000x more capacity than 4G,3 creating fertile ground for IoT development.<br> 5G and IoT are a perfect match, set to redefine how wireless networks—and the internet as a whole—are used.<br> With capacity for hundreds or thousands of devices seamlessly communicating, new applications and use cases for cities, factories, farms, schools, and homes will flourish. </p>
 <p>  Imagine 5G use cases involving thousands of sensors on hundreds of different machines automating supply chain management processes, ensuring just-in-time delivery of materials while using predictive maintenance to minimize work stoppages.</p>
 <p> Smart homes and cities will also take a giant leap forward in the future of 5G.<br> Using more connected devices than ever, AI will be taken to places it has never been before with edge computing.<br> From houses that give personalized energy-saving suggestions that maximize environmental impact to traffic lights that change their patterns based on traffic flow, 5G applications relying on added network capacity will impact nearly everyone. </p>
 <ul>
 <b><u><li> INCREASE BANDWIDTH  </li>  </b>  </u>
 </ul>
</div>
<div id="khatam">
 <P> The combination of increased speed and network capacity on 5G networks will create the potential for larger amounts of data to be transmitted than was possible with 4G LTE networks. </P>
 <P> 5G networks are architected differently from traditional 4G networks, allowing greater optimization of network traffic and smooth handling of usage spikes.<br> Crowded stadiums and other venues have struggled to provide seamless connectivity to large audiences,<BR> but 5G could make it possible for sports fans to live stream their experience from any seat in the arena.</P>
<p>  For businesses, the impact of increased bandwidth will echo across many departments and divisions in the form of big data.<br> Today, companies receive far more information from customers, suppliers, and teams than they can process and analyze for insights.<br> With 5G connectivity and big data analytics, these businesses can turn large volumes of data into actionable knowledge.</p>

<P id="h2">  Weather modification (also known as weather control) is the act of intentionally manipulating or altering the weather. The most common form of weather modification is cloud seeding, which increases rain or snow, usually for the purpose of increasing the local water supply.[1]<br> Weather modification can also have the goal of preventing damaging weather, such as hail or hurricanes, from occurring; or of provoking damaging weather against the enemy, as a tactic of military or economic warfare like Operation Popeye, where clouds were seeded to prolong the monsoon in Vietnam.<BR> Weather modification in warfare has been banned by the United Nations under the Environmental Modification Convention.

   STORM PREVANTION </div>
  <P id="ss"> The Florida company Dyn-O-Mat and its CEO, Peter Cordani, proposed the use of a patented product it developed, called Dyn-O-Gel, to reduce the strength of hurricanes.<BR> The substance is a polymer in powder form (a polyacrylic acid derivative) which reportedly has the ability to absorb 1,500 times its own weight in water.<br> The theory is that the polymer is dropped into clouds to remove their moisture and force the storm to use more energy to move the heavier water drops, thus helping to dissipate the storm.<br> When the gel reaches the ocean surface, it is reportedly dissolved. Peter Cordani teamed up with Mark Daniels and Victor Miller, the owners of a government contracting aviation firm AeroGroup which operated ex-military aircraft commercially. <br>Using a high altitude B-57 Bomber, AeroGroup tested the substance dropping 9,000 pounds from the B-57 aircraft's large bomb bay disbursing it into a large thunderstorm cell just off the east coast of Florida.
    <br> The tests were documented on film and made international news showing the storms were successfully removed on monitored Doppler radar.<br> In 2003, the program was shut down because of political pressure through NOAA. Numerical simulations performed by NOAA showed however that it would not be a practical solution for large systems like a tropical cyclone. </P>

 <div id="h4"><p> NOAA published a page addressing various ideas in regards to tropical cyclone manipulation.

  In 2007, "How to stop a hurricane"[17] explored various ideas such as:</p>
  <ul>
 <li>Using lasers to discharge lightning in storms which are likely to become hurricanes.</li>
 <li> Pouring liquid nitrogen onto the sea to deprive the hurricane of heat energy.</li>
 <li> Creating soot to absorb sunlight and change air temperature and create convection currents in the outer wall.</li>
 </ul></div>

 <p id="h5"> Researchers from NOAA's hurricane research division addressed hurricane control based ideas.
        <br>
Later ideas (2017) include laser inversion along the same lines as laser cooling (normally used at cryogenic temperatures) but intended to cool the top 1mm of water. If enough power were to be used then it may be enough, combined with computer modeling, to form an interference pattern able to inhibit a hurricane or significantly reduce its strength by depriving it of heat energy </p>

<div id="h7"><P> Operation popeye was a highly classified operation run by the US military in 1967-1972.<br> The purpose was to prolong Monsoon in Southeast Asia. The overwhelming precipitation successfully disrupted the tactical logistics of the Vietnamese army. <br>Operation Popeye is believed as the first successful practice of weather modification technology in warfare. After it was unveiled, weather modification in warfare was banned by the Environmental Modification Convention .
  In "Benign Weather Modification" published March 1997, Air Force Major Barry B.<BR> Coble superficially documents the existence of weather modification science where he traces the developments that have occurred, notably, in the hands of the Pentagon and CIA's staunchest ideological enemies. </P>
    <ul>
  <li>  The first scientifically controlled and monitored effort generally recognized by the meteorological community as constituting weather modification occurred in 1948. <br>When Dr. Irving Langmuir first experimented with artificially seeding clouds to produce rain, his experiments showed positive results – sparking tremendous interest in the field nearly overnight.</li>
<li>Many countries throughout the world practice weather modification.<br> The Russians have long been interested in using weather modification as a way to control hail.
In the 1990s a directive from the chief of staff of the Air Force Ronald R.<br> Fogleman was issued to examine the concepts, capabilities, and technologies the United States would require to remain the dominant air and space force in the future.</li>

<P>  Cloud seeding is a common technique to enhance precipitation.<br> Cloud seeding entails spraying small particles, such as silver iodide, onto clouds to attempt to affect their development, usually with the goal of increasing precipitation. Cloud seeding only works to the extent that there is already water vapor present in the air.<br> Critics generally contend that claimed successes occur in conditions which were going to lead to rain anyway.<br> It is used in a variety of drought-prone countries, including the United States, China, India, and Russia.<br> In China there is a perceived dependency upon it in dry regions, and there is a strong suspicion it is used to "wash the air" in dry and heavily polluted places, such as Beijing.<br>In mountainous areas of the United States such as the Rocky Mountains and Sierra Nevada, cloud seeding has been employed since the 1950s.  </P>
<p>  The United Arab Emirates has been cloud seeding since the 2000s and aims to increase rainfall by 15-30% per year. <br>The materials used are potassium chloride, sodium chloride, magnesium, and other materials.   </p>

<div id="h11">
<P>  A popular belief in Northern Europe that shooting prevents hail caused many agricultural towns to fire cannons without ammunition. <br>Veterans of the Seven Years' War, Napoleonic wars, and the American Civil War reported that rain fell after every large battle.<br> After their stories were collected in War and Weather, the United States Department of War in the late 19th century purchased $9,000 of gunpowder and explosives to detonate them in Texas, in hopes of condensing water vapor into rain. <br>The results of the test, supervised by Robert Dyrenforth, were inconclusive.
<BR>  Wilhelm Reich performed cloudbusting experiments in the 1950s, the results of which are controversial and not widely accepted by mainstream science </P>

In November 1954 the Thailand Royal Rainmaking Project (Thai: โครงการฝนหลวง) was initiated by the King Bhumibol Adulyadej. He discovered that many areas faced the problem of drought.<br> Over 82 percent of Thai agricultural land relied on rainfall. Thai farmers were not able to grow crops for lack of water.<br> The royal rainmaking project debuted on 20 July 1969 at his behest, when the first rainmaking attempt was made at Khao Yai National Park. Dry ice flakes were scattered over clouds. Reportedly, some rainfall resulted. In 1971,<br> the government established the Artificial Rainmaking Research and Development Project within the Thai Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperative.
 In January 2011, several newspapers and magazines, including the UK's Sunday Times and Arabian Business, reported that scientists backed by the government of Abu Dhabi,<br> the capital of the United Arab Emirates, had created over 50 artificial rainstorms between July and August 2010 near Al Ain, a city which lies close to the country's border with Oman and is the second-largest city in the Abu Dhabi Emirate.<br> The artificial rainstorms were said to have sometimes caused hail, gales and thunderstorms, baffling local residents.  </p>
